Hello swifties,

with this you get a small replication of the Compass-App on iPhones.
I did add a little feature for having different color themes either for night or for day usage.
It is fully written in Swift and I hope you find it usefull!

Leave a comment or thumbs up if you like.
Best regards
Andreas
